Welcome to the IT Career Path Creator project! 
This tool is designed to forge clear and accurate IT career paths for both budding students and seasoned developers. 
By analyzing current job market trends and recommending highly sought-after technologies, our goal is to streamline 
the learning process. We aim to save students time, enabling them to concentrate on acquiring the most impactful skills, 
and to assist IT professionals by highlighting avenues for advancement.

The genesis of this project was a blend of curiosity and a pivotal question: "Can we predict the future of the job market with state-of-the-art AI models?" 
The job market often serves as the prime indicator of future, and while the idea of applying advanced machine learning intrigued me, 
I quickly realized that developing a fully functioning application with such complex technology was beyond my current capabilities. 
Instead, I focused on gathering relevant data and implementing a basic FP Growth algorithm. This "playground" and idea behind it caught the attention of
a team of data engineers, who chose to develop my concept further as their project for the "DATA SCIENCE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT" course. 
Since then, my role has transitioned to collecting market data and serving as an advisor to the team.

You can see the evolution of this project by comparing the "production" branch, which showcases the data engineers' contributions, to my original work on the "master" branch.

This project isn't just another portfolio piece. This project stands as proof of how curiosity and teamwork can bring together a wide range of skills,
extending well beyond just programming.
